## Known Issues
- ~~The character creation dialogue box does not close for some reason~~
- ~~'Magic-User' default class for spells~~

## To-Do List
- Add the appropriate modifiers for all the attributes (partly implemented)
- Try to work out a way to add size category damage (S/M L) - partly implemented but not included in rolls
- ~~Validate monster saves as per FGG~~
- Modify preset abilities (open doors, bend bars etc. to FGG)
- Modify armour categories to FGG
- Consider weapon speed (this might be optimistic for my skills)
- Validate encumbrance  and speed with FGG
